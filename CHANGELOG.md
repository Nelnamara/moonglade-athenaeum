# Changelog

All notable changes to **Moonglade Athenaeum** — *a library against the Void.*

Format loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); releases are
git tags. Full prose notes for tagged versions live on
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Nelnamara/moonglade-athenaeum/releases).

> **Maintenance note.** This file is the in-repo source of truth — **update the `[Unreleased]`
> section with every change, and cut it into a dated version block when you tag a release.**
> GitHub Releases were published through **v1.6.0**, then paused; **v1.8.0–v1.10.0 were tagged but
> never released** — their notes are reconstructed here from tag messages + git history and are being
> back-published. There is **no v1.7.x** (the series jumped 1.6.0 → 1.8.0).

## [Unreleased]

_On `loom-v2`, past the `v1.10.0` tag. Headline work; see git history for the full list._

### Added
- **The full 57-achievement roster is live** — the achievement system grew from 11 to all **57**
  designed achievements (29 ladder rungs across 10 tracks · 9 milestones · 8 masteries · 11 hidden
  **feats**), generated verbatim from the canonical `docs/achievements_roster_57.json` with every
  achievement carrying its `roast` (and an unlockable uncensored variant). The panel groups them
  into **Evolution Ladders / Milestones / Masteries / Feats of the Athenaeum** sections; earned
  cards show their roast; **The Great Library** is flagged as a banner reward.
- **The telemetry layer** — the persisted counters behind every non-catalog metric
  (`out_dir/telemetry.json`: counters / maxima / sets / flags / distinct-days, lock-guarded and
  fail-soft everywhere). ~15 call sites now report in: edits, enhances (+ distinct workflows),
  fixes, uploads, LoRA use (first / stacked / distinct), video modes, Loom shots, "more like this",
  claims, skin + branding changes, `--organize`, `--dedup` culls, `--task-id` recoveries, free-card
  applies, day-of-use tracking, and new catalog SQL for `local_gens` / `gens_in_a_day` /
  `distinct_keywords`. Feat events ride a new `/api/ach-event` beacon (Konami egg, the in-Loom
  manual, narrator pokes) plus state sweeps (custom branding, the eclipse animation) and a
  new-download **Time Capsule** check.
- **Hidden feats + the narrator** — feats serve masked (`???`) until earned and the whole feats
  section stays cloaked until the first one lands; **poke the narrator** (the chibi in the
  Achievements header) until it snaps to earn *Triggered* and reveal the **Unleash the AI**
  toggle that swaps every roast to its uncensored variant.
- **Per-achievement badge + mascot art** — the 57 voted badges/mascots are served from
  `branding/badges/<id>.png` and `branding/mascots/ach/<id>.png`; the unlock moment now presents
  with **that achievement's own mascot** (falling back to the tier chibi), and the celebration
  queue/summary-toast handles the first-load burst.
- **The unlock moment IS the locked toast v2 design** (artifact `335ef4e7`): the badge medallion
  **sweeps right-to-left into a cap** with a ring pulse and glow-ding, the **mascot leaps from the
  toast's top edge** over a tier glow, "New Achievement" eyebrow, the **roast rides a read-along
  shimmer**, and a metallic rarity pill with a sheen — rarity-scaled hold + flash for
  legendary/feat, click to dismiss, queued for bursts. The >3-unlock summary uses the same frame
  (trophy in the well). Feat tier inside the toast = gunmetal band/pill + ruby glow + ruby inner
  rim on the cap.

### Changed
- **Feat tier restyle: gunmetal + ruby** — the feat tier's pink is gone; feats now wear a
  **gunmetal band** (`#8a93a2`) with a **ruby glow + ruby inner rim** (`#e0355e`) across the panel
  cards, section header, tier pill, unlock moment (ruby-tinted scrim, ruby/gunmetal confetti), and
  a new feat chime. New `--gunmetal` / `--ruby` design tokens.
- **Achievement quick-wins batch** — drop-in **SFX** (`branding/sfx/ach_<tier>.ogg` plays if
  present, synth chime otherwise) · legendary/feat **fanfare restored** (screen-level star rain +
  confetti, gold vs ruby-gunmetal) · **adaptive mascot seating** (each chibi's opaque artwork is
  measured and seated so ~75% rises above the toast band regardless of source-image padding) ·
  **reward ribbon** on unlock toasts (🎁 skin / ⚑ banner) · **Skins moved to the Control Panel**
  beside Branding (swatch grid, click-to-apply; the achievements modal links there).
- **The Loom V2** — a dockable-panel storyboard workspace (Acts & Shots board, runtime reel,
  Cast / Legend / Footage panels, timeline preview, and per-shot Generate tabs with
  continuity / camera / lighting), behind a **non-breaking "V2 layout" toggle** wrapped in an error
  boundary that falls back to the classic Loom. The **Video** and **Image** generate tabs are
  live — the Image tab generates a reference still for the selected shot (model picker +
  shot-seeded prompt over `/api/generate`, free-card aware) and **routes the result into the
  shot's open/close frame or cast**, so an in-Loom gen directly feeds the video render.
- **Loom Generate: Edit + Reference tabs** — all four Generate tabs are now live. **Edit**
  instruct-edits the shot's open frame (`/api/edit`, Edit Pro) and **Reference** composes a new
  still from the cast's `@image` members (Reference Pro, up to 10 refs); both poll and **route the
  result into the shot** exactly like the Image tab, share the balance line + friendly errors, and
  ride a shared `runGen`/`routeGen` so the proven Image path stays untouched.
- **Multiple storyboards in the Loom** — the Loom is no longer single-project. Each storyboard
  is saved under its own key in the existing server-side store (`storyboard:v2:proj:<id>`), with
  a **switcher in both the classic and V2 headers** (New · Open · Duplicate · Delete,
  close-on-outside-click; Rename via the name field) and an active-project pointer. Your existing project is **migrated in automatically** as the first
  storyboard on load; the legacy single-key project is preserved untouched as a backup. Verified
  end-to-end on a copy of real store data (migrate → new → switch, content intact).
- **Loom Generate: inline balance + friendly errors** — the Generate panel shows your live credit +
  card balance (`/api/account`) with a "+N claimable" hint, and gen failures now map the raw PixAI
  GraphQL error (e.g. `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`) to a human message ("out of balance — claim daily
  rewards or pick a card-covered model") instead of dumping the raw payload. Task-level failures
  now surface PixAI's own reason (the endpoint returns it as `status`, which the poll previously
  dropped) — content-moderation blocks read as a clear message instead of a bare "failed".
- **Achievements art & moments** — 11 achievement-badge prompts + the Loom mark, a
  mascot-per-state activity tracker, a rarity-scaled "Nel presents" unlock pop with real badge art,
  a spinning-Nel generation loader, and a Konami-code Starfall easter egg.
- **Recover a task by ID** — a Control Panel action to import any generation/edit into the catalog
  by task id, with an "already in your gallery" check + jump link.
- **Edit card** — multi-image references (Edit Pro 4 / Reference Pro 10) and
  capability-clamped resolution/quality/aspect (fixes the 4K-on-unsupported-model bug).
- **Economy surface** — distinct credits/cards chip, claimable badge, and credit expiry/cliff warnings.
- **Mobile portrait pass** — responsive layout ≤480px across header, grid, filters, drawer, lightbox.

### Changed
- **`--sync` is now the full one-shot refresh** — pull + full-meta → fix-models → backfill →
  **build missing thumbnails → reconcile cloud-deletes**, all idempotent (previously stopped after
  backfill). Reconcile is advisory and caught with a deliberately **broad `except Exception`** so a
  transient network error during its feed scan can't sink an otherwise-successful backup. Guarded by
  `tests/test_sync.py`; documented in `CLAUDE.md → "The one-shot sync (--sync)"`.

### Docs
- **State of the Suite** — code-verified status assessment (`docs/STATE_OF_THE_SUITE_2026-07-10.md`
  + `docs/state-of-suite.html`); corrected the stale `docs/REFINEMENTS.md` "Next up" list; started
  this changelog file.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-05 — Consolidation release
- **Live event push** — `--watch` / `--watch-backup` (graphql-transport-ws `personalEvents`,
  auto-collect finishing gens) **plus an in-server live-mirror watcher** (gens land locally the
  instant they finish; no separate CLI process).
- **Control Panel** — live progress bar (MGPROG protocol), Stop-this-job cancel, hourly scheduler.
- **Server control** — Stop/Restart from the browser via the `Serve Gallery.pyw` supervisor
  (exit-42 relaunch, single-instance guard, `serve.txt` args, `serve.log`).
- **Branding system** — choosable banner mark + 15 animations, frosted-pill nav, Desktop launcher `.lnk`.
- **Community** — contests (`--contests` / `/api/contests`), achievements + earnable skins,
  "Your Art" views + account entitlements.
- **Fixes** — batch under-capture (saved the grid, not the images), catalog-stats thumbnail
  double-count, `USER_ID` auto-resolve in `--sync-artworks`; CSV export is a real browser download;
  balance chip caches last-known credits.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-07-03
- **Jobs tray** (tasks survive drawer close), header **balance chip**, **Suggest-prompt** button,
  **prompt snippets/favorites**, and **printing** (print-friendly detail view + contact sheets).
- Sanitized reverse-engineering mechanism detail out of the public docs/wiki.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-07-03 — The web creation suite
- **Generate / Edit / Video drawer** — dockable to any screen edge, model/LoRA flyout with hover
  preview cards, LoRAs as attachments (not model overrides), Tag Suggestions in every prompt box.
- **Picker** — 900px modal browsing the whole catalog (infinite scroll), Collection/Source/Rating/Sort
  filters, upload, copy-prompt-on-pick.
- **Gallery → create bridges** — lightbox actions, right-click menu, multi-select → Video;
  Edit tab Edit | Enhance | Fix sub-tabs; eclipse-moon status spinner; in-app quick guide + full manual.

## [1.8.3] - 2026-07-03 — Claimable rewards
- `--claims` / `--claim` via `/v2/claim` (daily credits / agent stamina; read-only list, gated claim).

## [1.8.2] - 2026-07-03 — Image-to-prompt
- `--suggest-prompt` via `/v2/tag/suggest-prompt` (image → Danbooru-style tags + description; free).

## [1.8.1] - 2026-07-03 — Real credit cost in previews
- `price_task` via `/v2/task-price` — a generation's real credit cost, computed without creating it.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-03 — Full create suite + free-card auto-apply
- The complete create surface on one `createGenerationTask`: `--generate`, `--edit-image`,
  `--generate-video` (i2vPro), `--reference-video` (multi image/video/audio), `--enhance`
  (panelplugin workflows: face-fix / upscale / bg-remove + art filters), `--upload`.
- Free **"kaisuuken" cards auto-apply** on `--confirm` via the `/v2/kaisuuken` REST surface;
  `--dump-params` banks a submit shape with no browser; server-authoritative cost (`paidCredit`).
- GUI Video / Ref Video / Edit tabs; gallery detail → creation bridges. Cross-machine protocol +
  pinned line endings (`.gitattributes`).

_(No v1.7.x — the series jumped from 1.6.0 to 1.8.0.)_

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-28 — Curation + one-key setup
- **Collections** (images + videos), **select-mode + drag-paint** multi-select, scroll/selection
  persistence, detail-page keyboard nav.
- **One-key setup** — `config.json` is just `PIXAI_API_KEY`; `USER_ID` auto-resolves and the
  persisted-query hashes ship as built-in defaults.
- Fixed a JS error that killed the entire gallery script; added a `node --check` regression guard.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-27 — Moonglade Athenaeum 🌙
- **Rebrand** from "PixAI Gallery Backup" to a full local PixAI client (back up · browse · generate · curate).
- **`gql_adhoc()`** ad-hoc GraphQL POST — most ops need no persisted-hash capture; read-only `--account` dashboard.
- **Image generation** (`--generate` / Generate tab) with model + LoRA pickers, quality mode,
  priority, prompt-helper, aspect presets, `--task-id` recovery.
- **Manage & curate** — delete-from-PixAI (cloud + local), `--reconcile-deleted`, `--import-local`;
  Organize rebuilt into reversible `YYYY-MM/` month folders.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-06-24 — Media-type filter (All / Images / Videos).
## [1.4.3] - 2026-06-24 — 768px thumbnails (q90) for high-DPI displays.
## [1.4.2] - 2026-06-24 — Sharper thumbnails (512px / q90).
## [1.4.1] - 2026-06-24 — Video gallery fixes — posters generated during `--sync-videos`; click-to-play.
## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-23 — Image-to-video backup — `--sync-videos` downloads the real mp4 + gallery playback (`/video-file/<id>`, range support).
## [1.3.2] - 2026-06-23 — Fuller metadata (negative prompt, clip-skip), `/duplicates` review page, inline + bulk prompt editing.
## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-22 — Parallel workers (`--workers N`, default 4) for the batch jobs, not just downloads.
## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-22 — API-key auth, `--sync-artworks` (published metadata), LoRA tracking, dashboards, mobile/PWA, animated-artwork backup.
## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-22 — Duplicate audit/dedup (`--audit` / `--dedup` / `--verify-dupes`), gallery overhaul, parallel downloads + instant O(1) resume + incremental `--update`.
## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-13 — SQLite catalog (`catalog.db`, auto-migrate from CSV, `--export-csv`); SQL-backed gallery (~20× faster on large libraries); batch filter.
## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-13 — Initial release — bulk-download your own PixAI generations (backward pagination, media resolution, resume-by-media-id, catalog + prompt sidecar).
